# %R Larry Williams

## Description

&#x20;Williams Percent Range, is an oscillator indicator that measures overbought and oversold of the price.  It reflects the level of the close relative to the highest high for the look-back period. %R indicator is highly correlated with Stochastic,  but in contrast, the Stochastic Oscillator reflects the level of the close relative to the lowest low.  As a result, the Fast Stochastic Oscillator and Williams %R produce the exact same lines, the difference is just in the scalling of both indicators.

## Formula

%R = (Highest High - Close)/(Highest High - Lowest Low) \* -100

Where:

Lowest Low = lowest low for the look-back period\
Highest High = highest high for the look-back period\
%R is multiplied by -100 correct the inversion and move the decimal.



## Most useful cases

* **Indication of overbought/oversold levels -** Traditional settings are -20 as the overbought threshold and -80 as the oversold threshold. When %R value rises above -20 this is a sell signal and when %R value falls below -80 is buy signal.
* **Divergence/Convergence** - Divergence/Convergence pattern is a form of price action when new high(low) of the price not confirmed with a new high/low of  AO. Such price and indicator’s behavior can be interpreted as the weakness of current existing trend.
