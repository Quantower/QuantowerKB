### How to Reset All Settings to default

Sometimes all platform's settings need to be reset to default. To do this, close the platform, **Right-click** on Quantower icon and select **Open File Location** from the context menu.

You can save the current settings if you want to return to them later. Just rename your **Settings** folder to something else, like _**Settings\_My**_ etc.
{% endhint %}

_Rename the **Settings** folder_ (for example, Settings1 or Settings\_old). After you rename the folder, run the platform. The new Settings folder will automatically appear with default settings.

### How to share your Templates with other traders

{% hint style="success" %}
You can share your templates with other Quantower traders by sharing template files with them. Template files can be found in the folder **"Quantower -> Settings -> Templates"**

The file to be transferred must be placed in a similar folder on another computer
{% endhint %}

Recall that in the Quantower platform, all created templates are stored in the Control Center sidebar in the **"Templates"** group. Thus, you can launch any template from this location at any time with a single click. You can place your saved templates in the Favorites panel in the Control Center, just like any other default panel.

The file to be transferred must be placed in a similar folder on another PC.
