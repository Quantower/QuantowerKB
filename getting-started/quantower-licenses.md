# Quantower Licenses

We deliver the most popular trading and analytics functionality for free, but some valuable and market-specific features are available under the paid License.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have any questions regarding your Quantower Account or License purchase, please [contact our Support team](https://www.quantower.com/contact-us).
{% endhint %}

To use any paid License, the trader needs to have an active [Quantower Account](quantower-account.md). If you donâ€™t have one, you can create it during your License purchase process.

* Two indicators per chart
* One symbol overlay per chart
* One active connection to any broker, data feed, or exchange

{% endhint %}

Quantower can be operated indefinitely in this specific mode, allowing users to leverage its features without any time constraints.

### 7-day full-featured Trial period

To access all the features of the All-in-one version of Quantower, you can take advantage of the 7-day trial period. To do this, you must [register for a free Quantower account](quantower-account.md) and log in via the application. Once you confirm your account via email, the trial period will be automatically granted.

### Free version + one pro feature

If you want to purchase specific pro features instead of paying for the entire package, you can download and register for a Quantower account. Afterward, you can select and purchase the desired feature by clicking on the "Buy pro-features apart" link on the pricing page. This way, you can use the free version of Quantower along with the particular pro feature you require.

## License terms

You can purchase a license for as little as one month or a longer term of three months, six months, one year, or even a lifetime. This allows you to select the duration best suited to your requirements. The one-month license is ideal as a trial, while the longer-term licenses are perfect for ongoing access.&#x20;

### Lifetime term

A lifetime term gives you access to an All-in-one license or a particular feature license for the duration of the Quantower terminal's existence, including all future updates and functionalities covered by the license.

With a lifetime license, you can enjoy uninterrupted access to our Quantower without worrying about renewals or additional payments.
