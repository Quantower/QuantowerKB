# TPO Profile Chart

**Time Price Opportunity** or **TPO Chart**, shows the price distribution during the specified time, thus forming a profile. This allows you to understand at which levels or ranges the price has spent the most time, as well as to determine the main support and resistance levels.

### Key Elements of TPO Profile Chart

**Point of Control \(POC\)** — price level of the greatest market activity or trading volume. At this level, the price spent most time over the profile range.

**Value Area** — price range in which approximately 68% - 70% of the market activity or trading volume took place.

**Singles** or **single prints** of the profile are placed in the middle of a profile structure, not at the upper or lower edge. They occur on impulse movements and are used as support/resistance zones, which the price can test in the near future. The singles line indicates where the singles begin to form \(in cases when there are several single prints\).

**TPO letters** — basic element of the TPO chart, where each letter corresponds to a specific time \("**Build From**"\).
