### How to manage Quick Order Quantity buttons

Quick Order Quantity buttons will help you change the specified volume in one click, based on your trading strategy. You can set by default any parameters that you need to quickly change the values. Moreover, the buttons can change not only the specified position volume, but also apply any (!!!) formulas to calculate the order volume. To set your personal values for a quick change of the order, you need to go to the settings of the chart in the menu section "Order entry" and find the field "OE buttons"
